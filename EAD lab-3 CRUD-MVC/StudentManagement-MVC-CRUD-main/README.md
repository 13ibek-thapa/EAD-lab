## What is Laravel?

Laravel is a popular, open-source PHP framework designed to make web development faster, easier, and more enjoyable. It offers elegant syntax and a rich set of tools that help developers build modern, secure, and scalable web applications.

Key features of Laravel include:

- Powerful routing system  
- Built-in authentication and authorization  
- Database ORM called Eloquent for easy data manipulation  
- Blade templating engine for clean UI  
- Task scheduling and queues for background jobs  
- Robust security features

## Understanding the MVC Pattern

Laravel follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern, which separates an application into three main components:

- **Model:** Manages data and business logic. In Laravel, models interact with the database using Eloquent ORM.  
- **View:** Handles the user interface. Views are typically HTML templates with Blade syntax that display data to users.  
- **Controller:** Acts as an intermediary between Models and Views. It processes incoming requests, manipulates data using models, and returns views as responses.

This separation makes the codebase organized, maintainable, and scalable.

## CRUD Operations in Laravel

CRUD stands for **Create, Read, Update, and Delete** — the four fundamental operations to manage data in an application.

Laravel simplifies CRUD operations with Eloquent ORM and resourceful routing:

- **Create:** Add new records to the database using Eloquent’s `create()` or `save()` methods.  
- **Read:** Retrieve data using Eloquent’s query builder methods like `all()`, `find()`, or `where()`.  
- **Update:** Modify existing records using methods like `update()` or by setting model attributes and saving.  
- **Delete:** Remove records from the database with the `delete()` method.

Example of a simple CRUD workflow in a controller:

```php
// Create
$post = Post::create(['title' => 'New Post', 'content' => 'Content here']);

// Read
$posts = Post::all();

// Update
$post = Post::find(1);
$post->title = 'Updated Title';
$post->save();

// Delete
$post->delete();
